Hi!

This project revolves around a certain multiplayer DLC (Butcher Circus) for the game Darkest Dungeon.

It allows players to use modified backgrounds alongside colorgrades,,custom themed loading screens, custom themed torches and custom combat music!

I originally made this to keep myself from forgetting java (so same reason as my first project) but i eventually wanted to share my progress here in the end.

I will upload music-less releases on my github (due to upload size limit) while my drive will have thelatest bgchanger release *with* music

My drive also contains custom backgrounds outside of the ones used for progression mode (and other unrelated stuff).

Its also possible to configure yourself which colorgrade/loading screen/torch/music to use to a certain background, check my guide to see which keyword to use in which section.
